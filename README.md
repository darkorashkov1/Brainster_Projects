<h2 id="about-the-project">About Project_02</h2>

<details>
  <p>This UI project is about a web application that focuses on educating how to have a safe web experience. <br>This is a single-page application which has a static navigation bar and footer, contains 7 sections. The page does not support internationalization, the content is in Macedonian language.<br> This web application is fully responsive.
  <h3>Design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Figma project design was provided for this web application and build accordingly.<br>
  All the text content which is displayed in the application can be mocked by using any random text generator (Lorem Ipsum).</li>
    <li>The poster images and videos in the info page are switched with other local images corresponding the videos.</li>
    <li>Sign-out button was implemented changing from Sing-in on toggle. When the sign-out button is clicked, an alert message informs the user that is successfully signed out.</li>
    <li>Not found page was implemented to the HTML structure as a section corresponding to 404 error (page not found)</li>
    <li>on the landing page section a video banner was implemented instead of image which can be started by clicking the play button (appearing on hover)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Details to be used for logging-in to this web application:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Username: User123<br>Password: Pass123</li><br>
    <li>Username: User456<br>Password: Pass456</li><br>
    <li>Username: User789<br>Password: Pass789</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<h3 id="setUp">Set up</h3>
<p>In order to enable the login functionality, you need to set up a simple REST API locally written in Python with the Flask library. For this, you need to have Python installed locally (go to the “Files” section in the page and you will most probably need the “Windows installer (64-bit)” if you are running locally on Windows).<br>
After downloading the REST API locally, run it by using the following CLI command in the directory where the extracted REST API directory is located:
python '.\REST API\authenticator.py
</p><br>

<p>Download the REST API from the link below:</p>
